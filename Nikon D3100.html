       <p>Among my favourite gadget's has to by my Nikon D3100 camera which is a DSLR camera which stands for Digital Single Lens camera.
       The camera has offered me many memorable pics that i hold to heart.
       Kindly indulge me as we explore the different specs which makes this camera an almost must have gadget.</p>
      <h2><strong> General Overview</strong></h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong class="important">Exceptional image detail</strong>: The D3100 is built around a 14.2 megapixel CMOS sensor, bringing not only live view but also Full HD video capture to Nikon's entry-level model for the first time. In fact, this made it the first Nikon DSLR to offer 1920x1080 movie recording.</li>
            <img class="images" src="images/sample shot.jpg" alt="A sample photo">
          <li><strong class="important1">Catch the decisive moment</strong>: The D3100 can shoot approximately 3 frames per secondâ€”great for capturing dynamic motion and elusive facial expressions that are a challenge for any photographer. Simply rotate the release-mode selector and shoot away. Split-second shutter response eliminates the frustration of shutter delay, capturing moments that other cameras miss.</li>
           It can only record clips up to about ten minutes long (due to a 4Gb maximum file size limitation shared by all DSLRs), but this still counts as an impressive feature addition at this level.</li>
          <li><strong class="important2">Fast, precise 11-point autofocus system</strong>: The D3100's precision high-speed autofocus responds immediately to changes in scene or composition, maintaining tack-sharp focus to capture fleeting expressions and fast-moving sports.</li>
        </ol>
